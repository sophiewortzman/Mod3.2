The MainAlgorithm file is going to be where our completed/developing algorithm will be. 

In the main branch, I have also included all the files given to us to be used in our code (other files for Gazebo I didn't inlcude, but can upload if needed).

Most of this code will not work in an IDE (like PyCharm), so we won't really be able to test anything until it is actually in Gazebo (I think?).
