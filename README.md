The MainAlgorithm file is going to be where our completed/developing algorithm will be. 

In the main branch, I have also included all the files given to us to be used in our code (other files for Gazebo I didn't inlcude, but can upload if needed).

Most of this code will not work in an IDE (like PyCharm), so we won't really be able to test anything until it is actually in Gazebo (I think?).

This means that everyone will have to code their general idea of how your section will work.

It is possible to use dummy variables to test your code in PyCharm, like setting a speed for the rover wheels and making sure you getting the output you are looking for.
